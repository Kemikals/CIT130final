Introduction to Java final program

Final Project (150 points)

You will create a project of your own design, or you may pick from some of the suggestions I have below. Projects will be graded on the points as outlined in the requirements below. To get full credit for each part, the requirement must be fully implemented, implemented properly (using best practices), and make sense in the overall design of the application.

Requirements

1. Comments throughout the entire project pointing out where each requirement was met. (10 points)

2. For, while, do/while, and enhanced for loops should be used to keep the project running until the user wishes to end. At least 3 of the loops mentioned should be used. (15 points)

3. All values used in the program should be stored in variables. Whether value is local or class level, there should be variables used with no "literal" values. (10 points)

4. Methods: In addition to the main method there should be at least 3 other methods in the main class. These methods need to receive AND return values. (15 points)

5. Classes: There should be at least least 1 other class in your project with a minimum of 3 attributes, 3 behaviors, and at least 1 overloaded constructor and the default constructor. Objects of the class should be used in the application. (20 points)

6. Arrays: You need to use at least a single dimensional array and a multi dimensional array somewhere in the application. There must also be an array that stores a collection of one of the classes you create. (15 points)

7. Selections: If/else AND switch statements should be used somewhere in the application. (10 points)

8. There must be a static variable used somewhere. (10 points)

9. Design: The project cannot be just a demonstration of all of the items mentioned here. It must be a well thought our application that makes sense, and each requirement is implemented in a logical way to compliment that design. (25 points)

10. Variables, Classes, and Methods use the proper casing - camelCase, UpperCamelCase, ALLUPPER... (10 points)

11. Exception handling should be used to prevent your computer from crashing. Refer to chapter 8. (10 points)

The project should be zipped and uploaded to this module.

Some Suggestions for Projects

Taxes - Create a program that allows the user to do taxes. Obviously not every form, but a main part for gathering information, schedule A, schedule B, etc.

Small Business - Write a program that allow the user to update inventory, make sales transactions, pay employees, etc.

Multi Game - Create a program that will allow the user to play any number of interactive games created by you. Each game should be its own class, or collection of classes.

Checkers - Write a program that allows the user to play checkers against the computer. The computer doesn't have to be intelligent, but must make legal moves. You can use a 2 dimensional array to display the board. Make sure all moves are legal moves. (This can be a challenging one...)

Text Based Adventure - Create a program that allows the user to go on an adventure, choosing what to do through the console input, and implements the requirements listed above.

 Your own creation - Please check with me if you are not certain you are meeting the requirements. It is better to get that checked out with me earlier rather than later.
